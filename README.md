# rc381-Project 2: Rust CLI Binary with SQLite

This is a Rust command-line interface (CLI) application that interacts with an SQLite database. It provides functionality for loading data from a CSV file into the database and querying the database using SQL queries.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before using this application, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/nogibjj/individule-proj2-rc.git
   ```

2. Build the Rust binary using GitHub Actions:
   - The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically build and optimize the Rust binary. You can download it as an artifact once the workflow is complete.

## Use of GitHub Copilot
GitHub Copilot was used in the development of this project to accelerate code writing. It helped generate code snippets and provided suggestions during development, making the coding process more efficient and error-resistant.
