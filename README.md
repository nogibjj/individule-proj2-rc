# rc381-Project 2: Rust CLI Binary with SQLite

This is a Rust command-line interface (CLI) application that interacts with an SQLite database. It provides functionality for loading data from a CSV file into the database and querying the database using SQL queries.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before using this application, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/nogibjj/individule-proj2-rc.git
   cd proj2
   ```

2. Build the Rust binary using GitHub Actions:
   - The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically build and optimize the Rust binary. You can download it as an artifact once the workflow is complete.

## Outputs
